## Useful Commands

### Windows
* `ipconfig` - Adapter info for device
  * `ipconfig /all` - Shows additional info like MAC
* `ping` - Check basic connectivity to host
* `tracert` - Show hops from your PC to destination
* `nslookup` - Look up DNS `A` record for a given host (returns IP address)

### Linux
* `ip addr` - Similar information to `ipconfig` on Windows
* `route -n` - Seemed to be the fastest way to get default gateway
* `ifconfig` - Also fairly similar to `ipconfig`
* `ping -c 3` - Pretty much the same usage as for windows, but include `-c <some_number>` so that it doesn't loop forever.
* `traceroute` - Same as `tracert` in Windows.
