# NET-150

## Useful Commands

### Windows
* `ipconfig` - Adapter info for device
  * `ipconfig /all` - Shows additional info like MAC
* `ping` - Check basic connectivity to host
* `tracert` - Show hops from your PC to destination
* `nslookup` - Look up DNS `A` record for a given host (returns IP address)

### Linux
* `ip addr` - Similar information to `ipconfig` on Windows
* `ip route show` - Also fairly similar to `ipconfig`
* `route -n` - Seemed to be the fastest way to get default gateway
* `ifconfig` - Also fairly similar to `ipconfig`
* `ping -c 3` - Pretty much the same usage as for windows, but include `-c <some_number>` so that it doesn't loop forever.
* `traceroute` - Same as `tracert` in Windows.
* `arp -d <ip>` - Remove arp entry for `ip`
* `arp -n` - list known MAC's
* `ip -s -s neigh flush all` - Remove all known MAC's from ARP

## Cisco Routers
* `enable` allows privileged config (if the router has a password, you'd be prompted for it.)
* `config` to enter config mode
  * `router rip` to enter RIP
    * Set V2 with `version 2`
    * Add network with `network <ID>`
    * Exit with just `exit`
  * `exit` to exit (and save!) 
* `show ip route` shows information about routing settings (seems to include RIP and/or static)

## Other general notes

### Packet Tracer
* Don't use `cls` in a switch
* Hold control to deploy multiple
* Make sure to power on a switch
* Enter simulation mode: click "simulation" in bottom right
* Simulation filters: click "show all/none", then "Edit Filters"
* Setting default gateway in PC: Config -> Global -> Gateway/DNS IPv4
* Setting IP and subnet for an interface of a multilayer switch: Config -> Interface/FastEthernet0/X -> IP Configuration
* Switch settings (click save NVRAM to avoid depression!!)
* For sniffers, you might have to connect a hub/switch using crossover cable, whereas it doesn't seem to matter for routers...... 
* ***There's a button to send ping requests in the GUI!!!!*** It's the little one in the toolbar that looks like an envelope
* Connecting a router involved setting a "network ip" for each interface, wether it was going to a switch, or end device

### Wireshark filters:
* `arp` for ARP queries
* `icmp` or `icmpv6` for ICMP (but in our use case, mostly for PING)
