# gitea

For projects that are, y'know, normal, I gave up and installed gitea.

Gitea lets you do things that you'd expect, like, having a user account, orgs, and pull requests

That instance is at [https://git.xhec.dev](https://git.xhec.dev)

There were a couple of weird settings in Gitea's `app.ini`, but at least it was in the normal location of `/etc/gitea/app.ini`.&#x20;

The nginx config for it was fairly straightforward, too.
